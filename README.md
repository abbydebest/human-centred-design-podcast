# Human Centred Design Process

## Introduction & assignment
For this assignment we had to create a digital prototype solely tailored to one person with a disability and their wishes. We each got assigned to one of three people and I was paired up with Darice who is a creative designer with a feisty personality and she has been completely deaf since the age of 27. Her wish was to be able to follow a film or podcast and get a better intention and feeling of sound and emotion through sound. I ended up going with the latter. Here you can find my process on how I did it with the tests and challenges.

## Assignment choice
Starting with the project, I already had a slight preference to create a digital prototype based on a podcast. With this in mind, I set up some questions for the first test/introduction with Darice.

## Test #1 Introduction and orientation
