# Human Centred Design Process

## Introduction & assignment
For this assignment we had to create a digital prototype solely tailored to one person with a disability and their wishes. We each got assigned to one of three people and I was paired up with Darice who is a creative designer with a feisty personality and she has been completely deaf since the age of 27. Her wish was to be able to follow a film or podcast and get a better intention and feeling of sound and emotion through sound. I ended up going with the latter. Here you can find my process on how I did it with the tests and challenges.

# üë©üèº‚Äçüíª Week 1

## Assignment choice
Starting with the project, I already had a slight preference to create a digital prototype based on a podcast. With this in mind, I set up some questions for the first test/introduction with Darice.

## Test #1 Introduction and orientation
During this test we were introduced to Darice and we got to ask some questions.

### Questions for Darice

#### Which podcasts do you like/seem interesting to you?
* Bims
* The Handsome Podcast
* Humorous podcasts

#### What are things you enjoy doing on the internet?
* Coding, Instagram, YouTube, Ô£ø Podcasts

#### Which platforms do you like using and why? Because they're easy to use for you, or just because you enjoy them?
* Not really, typing on a phone

#### Can you experience music?
* I can distinguish different types of sounds due to later hearing loss

#### What things are difficult for you to perceive visually only? Humor, jokes? In other words, where do you miss the sound of a podcast the most?
* Sarcasm
* Certain kinds of sadness, high-pitched voices
* People talking over each other
* Voices (tones) don't come across well

#### Many podcasts are filmed ‚Äî does this work for you? What does and doesn‚Äôt work?
* Works very well

#### Tips and thing to keep in mind
* Build up and structure things
* People talking off-screen are very difficult
* Feeling vibrations
* Understands types of sounds
* Include everything
* If there‚Äôs no subtitles, I assume there‚Äôs no sound
* Things you can see aren‚Äôt necessary
* You can see them, but do you really get the impact?
* Worse vision on the left side, eye patch (‚Üí text in the center)
* Prefer names, no abbreviations

#### Ideas
* Each person their own color
* Text effects and animations
* Use color, size, flashing, and animations
* Color in the background of text
* Text depicted in images
* Speed of text/speech
* Caption for the caption for sarcasm
* Visualize sound along with the text and on screen
* Sentences that are interrupted, stitched together
* Let silence be felt ‚Äî footsteps, door slamming ‚Üí have visuals respond
* Eating sounds
* Separate different people/voices
* Represent the intensity of sound
* Continuously show (non-visible) emotions of people

### Concept
Darice her wish to be able to follow podcast immediately spoke to me and instantly made me think of videotaped podcasts with captions, that I myself follow without sound sometimes. When I asked her about it, she mentioned she enjoyed following these and that they work really wel for her. But that these are mostly parts of a podcast, which is why she mostly still uses the transcripted podcasts in apps such as Apple podcasts or Podimo.

I took a look at the Apple podcast transcript and immediately could envision Darice her frustration. Although, the podcast transcript is easy on the eyes and good to follow, it is boring/plain, has no emotion or nuance and it is impossible to know who is talking or interrupting, which makes it super hard to really experience what is going on and what the vibes are of the podcast.

In addition with everything she mentioned about things that are hard for her, with key things such as people interrupting each other, people speaking off camera and nuance in emotions. And seeing that these podcast video's still miss this as well, I decided I wanted to create a digital prototype that transcripts podcasts in a fun way with emotion(like humour), vibes(like choas), nuance, people interrupting and clearly seeing who is speaking all included.

I choose a fragment of the BIMS podcasts, a podcast Darice mentioned and likes, and one I can envision, comes over completely different in a 'normal'/now standard transcript, due to the strong personalities of the people and their hectic conversations.

### Transcript setup
We immediatly got handed a convenient repository from Vasilis, that made it possible to time text/captions linked to a YouTube video.
